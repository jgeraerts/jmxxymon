JMX monitor for xymon/big brother.

This is version 0.00001 - it compiles, it does some useful
stuff (I use it to monitor java systems at work), but it's still not 100% feature complete or
easy to use. 

Useful for monitoring tomcats, jbosses, etc.

Compile the code, see the test directory for examples, write a shell script to wrap the java calls.

TODO: 
- Rework the grammar to allow more interesting tests.
- Handle errors properly
- Allow comparison of retrieved values in parser.
